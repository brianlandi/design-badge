# Design Badge

Design Badge is a WordPress plugin that fixes a badge to to the front-end of pages for quick linking to design file assets. Custom meta fields will be added to all page templates giving you the ability to turn on the design badge for that page.

## Features

- Select design tool to render appropriate icon (Figma, Sketch, Adobe)
- Set the the design at the page level or use a default global link
- Upload a custom design badge image and set a custom background color
- Set the vertical fixed position on the page.

## Upcoming

At some point in the future I may add the option to overlay a design image on the page.
